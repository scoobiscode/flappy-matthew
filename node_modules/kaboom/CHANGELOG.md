### kaboom2000 (unreleased)

- added `burp()` for easy burping
- added decent typescript support and jsdocs
- revamped visual style, changed default font and debug font
- introducing new character "bean"
![bean](sprites/bean.png)
- added `loadBean()` to `"bean"` as a default sprite
- added comp `health()` to manage health related logic
- added comp `move()` to manage projectile-like behavior
- added comp `outline()` to draw a lil outline
- added comp `timer()` to attach timers to a game obj
- added comp `fixed()` to make a game obj unaffected by camera
- added comp `stay()` to make a game obj stay after scene switch
- added comp `lifespan()` to destroy game obj after certain amount of time
- added comp `z()` to define draw order for objs on the same layer
- added `weight` to `BodyComp` and `BodyCompConf` to control the gravity multiplier
- added `djump()` to `BodyComp` for double jump
- added `dir()` to calculate directional vector from angle
- added constants `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `UP`, `DOWN` for unit directional vector
- added `fullscreen()` to enable real fullscreen mode
- (**BREAK**) changed color from 0-1 range to 0-255, angles from radians to degrees
- `global` and `debug` flag now are enabled by default, need to turn off manually if you don't want
- added input events `touchStart(id, pos)`, `touchMove(id, pos)`, `touchEnd(id, pos)`, `mouseMove(pos)`
- added `font` field in `KaboomConf` to set the default font
- added `mouseDeltaPos()`
- added `touchToMouse` to control if touch events should be translated to mouse events
- added `mousePos()` now gets the screen mouse pos, use `mouseWorldPos()` to get the mouse position affected by camera
- added `anim` field in `SpriteCompConf` to play an anim on start
- beter type support for components
- `scene()` and `start()` (also removed in favor of `go()`) are optional now, if you don't need multiple scenes yet you can just go directly
```js
kaboom();
// no mandatory scene() to start kabooming
add(...);
keyPress(...);
```
- (**BREAK**) `area()` is now explicit and not automatically added by `sprite()`, `rect()`, and `text()`, removed each `noArea` or `area` config field
```js
add([
    sprite("bean"),
    area(), // empty area() will calc size from the sprite
]);
```
- (**BREAK**) `area()` now takes an `AreaCompConf`, where you can define the area points, size, scale, and hover cursor
- audio is now paused when you leave the tab
- audio is now paused on `debug.paused = true`
- added localStorage helper `getData(key, default?)` and `setData(key, data)`
- added `loadShader(id, vert, frag, isUrl)`
- added `shader()` comp for attaching custom shader to an obj
- all event handlers like `keyPress()`, `mouseClick()`, `action()`, `collides()` now returns a function to cancel that listener
- added `require` on component definitions, making it possible to declare dependencies for components, e.g.
```js
function alwaysRight() {
    return {
        // the id of this component
        id: "alwaysRight",
        // list of component ids that this requires
        require: [ "pos", ],
        update() {
            // so you can use `move()` from pos() component with no worry
            this.move(100, 0);
        },
    };
}
```
- (**BREAK**) overlapping component fields are not allowed, e.g. you can have a custom comp that has a `collides` field if it already have a `area` component, since it already has that
- (**BREAK**) changed `text(txt, size, conf)` to `text(txt, conf)` with `size` as a field
- added `obj.c(id)` for getting a specific comp's state (by default all comps' states are mounted to the obj by `Object.defineProperty`)
```js
// both works
obj.play("anim");
obj.c("sprite").play("anim");
```
- pedit, aseprite, cga plugins are now included by default
- added `addKaboom()` for quick kaboom explosion

- added `moveTo(dest: Vec2, speed?: number)` to `pos()` comp
- added `keyPress()` (and all other key events) with no arg to check for any key
- (**BREAK**) renamed `camShake()` to `shake()`
- (**BREAK**) remove `flipX()` and `flipY()` on `scale()` comp
- (**BREAK**) removed `start()` in favor of `go()`
- (**BREAK**) removed `changeSprite()` in favor of `use(sprite("newsprite"))`
- (**BREAK**) renamed `rmTag()` to `untag()`
- (**BREAK**) removed `camIgnore()` in favor of `fixed()`
